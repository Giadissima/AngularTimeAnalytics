# AngularTimeAnalytics

AngularTimeAnalytics is an Angular-based project that provides a powerful tool for temporal analysis and statistical data visualization. This web application allows you to monitor and explore data related to alarms and people within a specific time range. You can customize the time range using a date picker or select predefined sets like the last week, last month, last hour, today, or yesterday. Additionally, you have control over the data update frequency, which can be configured to meet your needs. Effectively explore and analyze temporal data with AngularTimeAnalytics.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
